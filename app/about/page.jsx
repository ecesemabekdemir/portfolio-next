          Hello! I'm <span>Sema Bekdemir</span>, a Frontend Developer passionate
          about creating modern, user-friendly, and responsive websites. I
          combine my design and development skills to build web projects that
          stand out. I initially studied interior architecture and construction
          technology, and during that time, I gained design knowledge that I
          later applied to the world of software development. I started
          improving myself in frontend development, working with technologies
          such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js. I also enjoy
          turning Figma designs into functional web projects by integrating them
          with code. I'm constantly developing my own projects and eager to keep
          learning and exploring new technologies in the field.
